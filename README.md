# Umbraco-Maui

This repo is a companion to my talk, first given at the Umbraco UK festival 2023 and at other conferences since. It shows how to use Umbraco and .NET MAUI together to build a cross-platform app which will load content from the Umbraco content Delivery API.

Slides are available here : [Umbraco & .NET Maui](Umbraco & .NET Maui.pptx)

## Future Amenda

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- Webhook to trigger a push notification
- Move Services and common code to a shared library project
- Blog posts on a separate view
